# 30 Days DevOps Challenge (AWS)
A number of challenges which provide hands-on experience with developer toolset and AWS services

## Challenge Overview
- **Day 1:** Building a weather data collection system using **AWS S3** and **OpenWeather API** - [30days-weather-dashboard](https://github.com/lcribbes/aws-devops-challenge/tree/main/30days-weather-dashboard)
- **Day 2:** Building a sports alerts system that sends real-time NBA game day score notifications to subscribed users via SMS/Email. Leveraging **Amazon SNS**, **AWS Lambda and Python**, **Amazon EvenBridge** and **NBA APIs** to provide sports fans with up-to-date game information. The project demonstrates cloud computing principles and efficient notification mechanisms. - [game-day-notifications](https://github.com/lcribbes/aws-devops-challenge/tree/main/game-day-notifications)
- **Day 3:** Creating a data lake for NBA analytics using AWS services. Creates a **AWS S3 bucket** to store raw and processed data. Uploads sample NBA data (JSON format) to the S3 bucket. Creates an **AWS Glue** database and an external table for querying the data.

- **Day 4:** Building a containerized API management system for querying sports data. It leverages **Docker** and **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** for creating and running containers, **Amazon API Gateway** for exposing REST endpoints, and an external **Sports API** for real-time sports data. The project showcases advanced cloud computing practices, including API management, container orchestration, and secure AWS integrations - [containerized-sports-api](https://github.com/lcribbes/aws-devops-challenge/tree/main/containerized-sports-api)
- **Day 5:** This project uses RapidAPI to obtain NCAA game highlights using a **Docker** container and uses **AWS Media Convert** to convert the media file. - [NCAAGameHighlights]([https://github.com/lcribbes/aws-devops-challenge/tree/main/containerized-sports-api](https://github.com/lcribbes/aws-devops-challenge/tree/main/NCAAGameHighlights))
